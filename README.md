# ELiteTEch-Intern
These tasks contains Jupyter Notebooks and dashboards developed during an internship at ELiteTech.

ðŸ”¹ **Task 1**: Big Data Analysis

Tool Used: PySpark
Dataset: NYC Taxi Trip Data

What I Did:
Used PySpark to handle and analyze a large CSV dataset (taxi_tripdata.csv) efficiently.
Performed data cleaning, selected relevant columns, and computed insights such as trip distances, fare amounts, and passenger counts.
Aggregated data to find top zones by trip count and calculated average fares and distances.
Outcome: Successfully demonstrated scalable big data processing using PySpark with insightful visual and tabular analysis.

ðŸ”¹ **Task 2**: Predictive Analysis using Machine Learning

Tool Used: Scikit-learn
Dataset: Iris Flower Dataset

What I Did:
Loaded and explored the Iris dataset to understand the distribution of features across species.
Applied preprocessing techniques including label encoding and feature scaling.
Trained classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression and Decision Tree) to predict the iris species.
Evaluated models using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.
Outcome: Achieved high classification accuracy, successfully predicting flower species based on sepal and petal dimensions.

ðŸ”¹ **Task 3**: Dashboard Development

Tool Used: Power BI
Dataset: Superstore Sales Data (sales.csv)

What I Did:
Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize sales performance across product categories, regions, and time.
Implemented dynamic filtering for regional and category breakdowns, and created line, bar, and pie charts to show trends and distributions.
Highlighted key insights such as peak sales periods, top-performing regions (West), and most profitable categories (Technology).
Outcome: Delivered a clean and informative dashboard enabling quick and clear sales performance analysis.

ðŸ”¹ **Task 4**: Sentiment Analysis

Tool Used: Python (NLTK / TextBlob / Scikit-learn)
Dataset: Twitter Tweets on Product Reviews

What I Did:
Cleaned and tokenized tweets.
Used TF-IDF vectorization and trained a logistic regression model.
Classified tweets into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.
Outcome: Achieved ~85% accuracy in sentiment prediction and visualized sentiment distribution.
